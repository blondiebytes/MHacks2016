# Overview
Travel Broke is a web application that helps you find a spontaneous weekend getaway. Users input their current location, a budget, and their travel avaliability and Travel Broke gives them three options beween some awesome 2-3 day adventures. This app works to find the most afforable flights and hotel rooms for the world's most popular destinations. Users can also register their phone number so that they can be updated when a cheap flight is avaliable in their area. You could get a text Friday morning saying there's a $50 round-way trip flight to Bermuda for the weekend and just go! With Twilio's API, users can also book flights and hotels straight from a text. Travel Broke is about less hassle and more adventure for those who think they don't have the time or money to travel.
